# Factsheet Widgets

Factsheets can be built using a selected set of widgets: Basic, Performance Analytics, and Factor Analytics. The Performance and Factor Analytics widgets are pre-calculated based on the uploaded return data and the selected benchmark.

- **Basic**: A flexible widget that allows adding custom content such as formatted tables, time series charts, free text, and images. It can be used to present supplementary information, showcase strategy highlights, or include additional visualizations beyond standard analytics.
- **Performance Analytics**: Provides visual and statistical insights into return performance. Includes charts like cumulative and rolling returns, historical drawdowns, risk/return scatter plots, and return distribution histograms. It also highlights key performance metrics such as annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and worst/best months.
- **Factor Analytics**: Analyzes how the strategy's returns relate to various risk factors (e.g., market, size, value, momentum). Displays factor exposures, factor contribution to performance, and regression-based metrics such as alpha and beta relative to selected benchmarks or factor models.
