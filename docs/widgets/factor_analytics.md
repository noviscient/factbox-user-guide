# Factor Analytics

This section requires two different datasets: return data and historical Fama-French factors.

## Current Factor Exposures

The factor exposures are calculated using the Fama-French Global Four-Factor Model and reflect exposures over the most recent calendar year.

- **Market**:  
  Risk associated with the general movement of the market.

- **Momentum**:  
  Indicates that the portfolio includes assets with a history of strong performance that continue to exhibit positive momentum.

- **Value**:  
  Measures the impact of investing in undervalued assets relative to their book value.

- **Size**:  
  Captures the performance difference between small-cap and large-cap stocks, with a focus on smaller companies.

The percentages in the graph represent the strength of the relationship between the returns of the strategy/product and each factor.
